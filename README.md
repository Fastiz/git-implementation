# git-implementation

Git-implementation is a simple and personal implementation of git. It was built for exploring the internals of git and try some things.

It is implemented in kotlin with [koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) for dependency injection and it follows the N-tier pattern.

## Supported commands

- `init`
- `commit <path>...`
(note: because there is no add command commit includes the paths that would be in the index)
- `log`
- `checkout <commit-id>` 
(note: everything that is not in the tree is discarded)

## How to run

Create a jar that includes all the project dependencies:
```
./gradlew :fatJar
```
The output will appear in `build/libs`.
Run the jar:
```
java -jar <path to git-implementation-X.X-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar> <arguments>
```

where `arguments` from the list of supported commands.
(note: make sure that the .jar is not in the same folder as the git project because it will not be ignored and will be erased on checkout)

Also it's possible to create an alias for running the jar with:
```
alias <name>=java -jar git-implementation-X.X-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```

### Example
```
// initializes git in the directory
java -jar <path to git-implementation-X.X-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar> init

// create a directory and some files
mkdir dir1
touch file1 dir1/file2

// creates a commit including the created files and it will output a commit hash
java -jar <path to git-implementation-X.X-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar> commit file1 dir1/file2

// create some other directories and another file
mkdir dir2
mkdir dir2/dir3
touch dir2/dir3/file3

// creates another commit including the new file and will output a different commit hash
java -jar <path to git-implementation-X.X-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar> commit dir2/dir3/file3

// list the content of the directory to see all the files created so far
ls

// show the hashes of the two commits created
java -jar <path to git-implementation-X.X-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar> log

// checkout to the previous commit by using the hash of the output of the first commit
java -jar <path to git-implementation-X.X-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar> checkout <first-commit-hash>

// list the content of the directory to see only the files that were in the first commit
ls
```

## How to run tests
Run junit test suite:
```
./gradlew test
```
